Feature	Current State	Requirement	Gap
Real-Time Live Video	Not working (WebRTC issue).	Seamless video for both users.	Needs WebSocket and STUN server setup.
Request/Response	Missing learner posts and mentor replies.	Full request/response system.	Entirely absent; needs new workflow.
Timers/Reminders	No session timers or notifications.	Timers and reminders for sessions.	Missing; requires backend scheduling.
Payments/Withdrawals	Payment fails; no withdrawal option.	Secure payments and withdrawals.	Payment integration broken; withdrawals absent.

In-Depth Solutions
1. Real-Time Live Video: Ensuring It Works
Objective: Enable seamless face-to-face video for learners and mentors.
Requirements:
WebRTC for peer-to-peer video.
WebSocket for signaling between users.
STUN/TURN servers for network traversal.
Solution:
Setup: Use a service like Google’s STUN server (stun:stun.l.google.com:19302) and a TURN server (e.g., via a third-party provider like Twilio) for reliable connections.
Flow:
Learner Perspective: Click "Join Session" → WebRTC initiates local stream → WebSocket signals mentor → Video connects.
Mentor Perspective: Receive session request → Accept → Join via WebRTC → Video connects with learner.
Technical Needs:
Configure Django Channels with a Redis backend for WebSocket support.
Ensure both users have browser permissions for camera/microphone.
Real-Time Updates: Display "Live Now" badge and participant count on dashboards.
Error Prevention: Test connections across networks, handle permission denials, and provide fallback messages (e.g., "Check camera settings").
2. Request/Response System
Objective: Enable learners to post requests and mentors to respond.
Flow:
Learner: Navigate to "My Posts" → Create a request (e.g., "Need Python help") → Submit → Request appears in mentor dashboard.
Mentor: View requests → Respond with session details (date, price) → Learner receives notification → Accept or decline.
Real-Time: Use WebSocket to notify mentors of new requests and learners of responses instantly.
Solution:
Add a "Posts" section on the learner dashboard and a "Requests" section on the mentor dashboard.
Implement a notification system (e.g., pop-ups or emails) for responses.
Actions: Learner accepts response → Session is booked; Mentor can cancel if no response within 24 hours.
3. Timers and Reminders
Objective: Notify users of session start/end times.
Flow:
Setup: Use a background task (e.g., Celery with Redis) to schedule reminders.
Timeline:
24 hours before: Email/SMS reminder.
10 minutes before: Dashboard pop-up ("Session starts soon!").
End time: Auto-mark session as "ended" and notify for feedback.
Solution:
Display a countdown timer on session cards (e.g., "Starts in: 04:46:53").
Send reminders via a third-party service (e.g., Twilio for SMS, Django email for emails).
Actions: Users can snooze reminders or join sessions directly from notifications.
4. Payments and Withdrawals
Objective: Ensure secure payments and enable mentor withdrawals.
Flow:
Payment:
Learner books session → Added to Cart → Proceeds to Razorpay checkout → Payment confirmed → Session booked.
Withdrawal:
Mentor earns from sessions → Requests withdrawal → Admin approves → Funds transferred (e.g., via bank transfer).
Solution:
Payment: Debug Razorpay integration, test in sandbox mode, and log errors for troubleshooting.
Withdrawal: Add a "Withdrawals" section on the mentor dashboard with a form for bank details and amount.
Real-Time: Update balances on dashboards after each transaction.
Actions: Learner retries payment if failed; Mentor submits withdrawal request with a 48-hour approval period.
5. Progress Tracking
Objective: Provide detailed progress for learners.
Flow:
Track completed sessions, hours spent, and goals (e.g., "Learn Python Basics").
Display a dashboard widget with stats (e.g., "35% of 10 sessions completed").
Solution:
Calculate progress based on session completions and learner goals set during registration.
Show a progress bar with milestones (e.g., "Next: 50% at 5 sessions").
Actions: Learner can update goals; Progress updates after each session.
Enhanced Web Flow and Page Design
Best UI/UX Approach
Design: Adopt a glassmorphism theme with cards, rounded corners, and subtle animations (e.g., fade-in for session updates).
Real-Time Analytics: Use WebSocket to push live data (e.g., participant count, session status) to dashboards.
Responsive: Stack cards vertically on mobile, with a hamburger menu for navigation.
Page Structure and Content
Landing Page (/)
Show: Hero image, "Find Sessions" CTA, top mentors.
Actions: Login/Register, Browse Sessions.
Learner Dashboard (/dashboard/learner/)
Show: Welcome message, progress (e.g., 35%, 3/10 sessions), upcoming sessions (with timers), recommendations, "My Posts" section, real-time analytics (e.g., "1 user live").
Actions: Join session, create post, view progress, book sessions.
Mentor Dashboard (/dashboard/mentor/)
Show: Welcome message, scheduled sessions (with timers), requests, earnings, "Withdrawals" section, real-time analytics (e.g., "1 learner joined").
Actions: Accept requests, start session, request withdrawal, view earnings.
Find Sessions (/sessions/)
Show: Session cards with thumbnails, search bar (expandable), filters (topic, price), real-time availability.
Actions: Search, filter, book session.
Session Detail (/session/<room_id>/)
Show: Session title, mentor info, timer ("Starts in: 04:46:53"), "Join Session" button, payment status.
Actions: Join session, share session, pay if pending.
Cart (/cart/)
Show: Items, total, payment status, error messages if failed.
Actions: Remove item, retry payment, proceed to checkout.
Posts (/posts/)
Show: Create/edit posts, response history, real-time notifications.
Actions: Submit post, accept/decline responses.
Feedback Modal
Show: Rating stars, text input, submit button.
Actions: Submit feedback, view past feedback.
Both Dashboards: Server-Side Real-Time Live Analysis
Setup: Use Django Channels with WebSocket to push updates every 5 seconds.
Data to Show:
Learner Dashboard: Live session count, mentor availability, progress updates.
Mentor Dashboard: Learner join status, session duration, earnings updates.
Actions Flow:
Learner joins → Mentor notified → Video starts → Both see real-time stats → Session ends → Feedback collected.
Final Recommendations
Best Way Forward
Priority: Fix real-time video (WebRTC, WebSocket) first, as it’s the core feature.
Implementation:
Set up STUN/TURN servers and test video connections.
Add request/response, timers, and payment/withdrawal flows next.
Redesign UI with real-time analytics last.
Testing: Conduct end-to-end tests for video, payments, and workflows across devices.
Support: Provide a help center with guides for video setup and payment issues.

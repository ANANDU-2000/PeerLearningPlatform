PeerLearn Landing Page Navigation Plan
Overview
The Landing Page (/) serves as the entry point for PeerLearn, attracting users with real-time top live sessions and best mentor sessions in horizontally scrollable cards, sourced from the SQLite3 database. The navigation (nav) is a key component, providing clear access to critical actions through specific items like Sessions, Mentors, Login, and Register, with enhanced interactions to make the experience premium and engaging. The nav is responsive, adapting to web (sticky header with hover effects) and mobile (collapsible hamburger menu with tap animations), and ensures users are guided toward browsing sessions, discovering mentors, or signing up with minimal clicks. After registration or login, users are redirected to their role-specific dashboard (learner or mentor), with no homepage access unless logged out.

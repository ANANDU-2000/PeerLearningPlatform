Plan for Smart Pre-Session Management (Your Request)
üöÄ 1. Pre-Session Sound Alerts + Countdown Timer

Feature	Action
Timer Countdown	5 minutes before session, show countdown timer (e.g., "Session starts in 5:00")
Sound Notification	1 gentle chime (like ding!) sound at 5 min, 1 min, and 10 sec left
Pop-up Notification	Desktop/mobile push: "Your session is starting! Please join now."
Auto-Focus Button	"Join Session" button becomes big, animated (glow effect)
Urgent Mode (Last Minute)	Flashing "Join Now!" button + Auto-scroll to Join section
‚ú® 2. Smart Auto-Join Feature (Optional Toggle)

Feature	Action
Auto-Join Enabled	If user is on PeerLearn website and session timer hits 0:00, automatically joins session
Auto-Join Disabled	If user not ready, keep "Join Now" button active with sound alerts
Fallback	If join fails due to network, show "Retry Join" popup automatically
üî• Extra: Mentor and Learner can both get "Session About to Start" reminder through a gentle voice notification if you want.

‚ö° 3. Real-Time Issues Handling (WebRTC + Server Side)
Here is a full breakdown of all real-time failures and smart solutions we will implement:


Issue	Smart Handling	Message
WebRTC ICE Failure	3 retries ‚Üí Auto re-connect ‚Üí Else show "Click to Retry Connection"	"We're reconnecting you. Hang tight!"
TURN Server Unavailable	Switch to lower bitrate streaming mode automatically	"Low bandwidth mode activated for stability."
Camera/Mic Blocked	Prompt user to allow permissions again	"Please enable your mic/camera to join session."
STUN Timeout	Try secondary server (fallback)	"Connection retrying on backup server‚Ä¶"
User Closes Tab	Save exit event, prompt to rejoin session if within 2 minutes	"You left the session. Want to rejoin?"
Mentor Leaves	Freeze session for learner, show "Mentor rejoining..." screen	"Mentor disconnected, please wait..."
Learner Leaves	Notify mentor silently, timer pause, "Waiting for learner..." message	
Internet Cut	Auto-reconnect tries 3x ‚Üí After that, show "Network issue, please refresh" popup	
Peer Connection Drop Mid-Session	Auto-attempt rejoin in 3 seconds (up to 3 attempts)	
üõ°Ô∏è 4. Real-Time Server Setup for Maximum Stability
We need strong real-time server logic:


Part	Requirement
Django Channels	For WebSocket real-time messaging
Redis Server	For managing live WebSocket connections
STUN/TURN Servers	For WebRTC peer-to-peer signaling (Google STUN + Coturn TURN)
MediaRecorder	For optional session recording locally
WebSocket Health Check	Every 10 seconds ping-pong between client and server ("Alive?")
Logs & Alerts	Send errors (disconnects, RTC drops) to server logs for monitoring
API Rate Limits	To protect against abuse
Mobile Optimization	Background join reminder if mobile screen is locked
üåü Smart Flow for Pre-Session:
5 minutes before:
‚Üí Chime Sound
‚Üí Countdown visible
‚Üí "Join Now" button activated

1 minute before:
‚Üí Louder chime
‚Üí Popup: "Get ready to join!"

10 seconds before:
‚Üí Final chime
‚Üí If Auto-Join enabled ‚Üí auto move into session.

Session Start Time:
‚Üí If user joined, session starts
‚Üí If not, show "You missed your start, Join Now!" retry popup.
